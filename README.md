This contains documentation for installation and maintenance for the DSA, Girder and HistomicsTK

## What is the Digital Slide Archive?

The CDSA was originally developed to support the visualization of large whole slide images for cancer.  The DSA is the basic platform/system that supports data upload, permissions, etc..   So the CDSA is a specific <i>instance</i> of the DSA software.  The same system can (and hopefully will!) be used for lots of supports.

## The DSA Components
The DSA consists of two primary components, and I realize the semmantics get a bit confusing!  

The DSA = Digital Slide Archive = Object Management and Slide Visualization Tools
HistomicsTK is a set of (mostly) python based algorithms that support the analysis of WSI Images.

There are a lot of documentation we are still in the process of curating.. to get started with actually installing the Digital Slide Archive (DSA) using docker... start from [here](https://github.com/DigitalSlideArchive/digitalslidearchive.info/blob/master/DSA_Girder_Installation/DSA_Installation.md)
