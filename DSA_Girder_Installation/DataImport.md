There are several ways to ingest data into Girder/DSA and each has their advantage/disadvantages.  In most cases, I 'ingest'
data this is already saved somewhere on a file system that DSA/Girder is able to access.  You can also drag/drop a set of files
or images into the UI and they get uploaded.  Finally, you can use the API to upload data to the server.


## What's the difference
The big difference is where the files are stored, and also <i>how</i> they are stored.  So in scenario 1, I already have 
an existing slide collection of slides.  There's some basic organization of the slides into folders, and I want to replicate 
this organization in the DSA.  In this case, I really want to <i>index</i> the files as they are on the file system, and
inherit the file structure/file names/etc.  

So in this case, I go to AssetStore and Import..

TO DO:  ADD PICTURE
