There are several ways to ingest data into Girder/DSA and each has their advantage/disadvantages.  In most cases, I 'ingest'
data this is already saved somewhere on a file system that DSA/Girder is able to access.  You can also drag/drop a set of files
or images into the UI and they get uploaded.  Finally, you can use the API to upload data to the server.


## What's the difference
The big difference is where the files are stored, and also <i>how</i> they are stored.
