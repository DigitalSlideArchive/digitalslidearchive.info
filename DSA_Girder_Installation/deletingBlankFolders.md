I accidentally created blankFolders when I had a script run that was helping me reorganize my slide data.  In this case, I created
7 folders for each patient and each possible stain that could have been done.  However many patients didn't have any slide(s) with stain X,
and so I wanted something to find empty folders and then prune them.

I did this using the girder python API.
